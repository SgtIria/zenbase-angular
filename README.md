## Zenbase-angular

Yet another Angular boilerplate. Why? Why not! Boilerplates come in many flavours. Zenbase is intended to be light and flexible, but with a few opinionated choices up-front.

Zenbase is designed with the developer's productivity in mind. We keep things light and to the point, without an unnecessary amount of gulp plugins. This should get you coding asap.
